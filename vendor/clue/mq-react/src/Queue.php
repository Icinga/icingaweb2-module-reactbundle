/**
 * The `Queue` is responsible for managing your operations and ensuring not too
 * many operations are executed at once. It's a very simple and lightweight
 * in-memory implementation of the
 * [leaky bucket](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leaky_bucket#As_a_queue) algorithm.
 *
 * This means that you control how many operations can be executed concurrently.
 * If you add a job to the queue and it still below the limit, it will be executed
 * immediately. If you keep adding new jobs to the queue and its concurrency limit
 * is reached, it will not start a new operation and instead queue this for future
 * execution. Once one of the pending operations complete, it will pick the next
 * job from the qeueue and execute this operation.

    /**
     * Concurrently process all given jobs through the given `$handler`.
     *
     * This is a convenience method which uses the `Queue` internally to
     * schedule all jobs while limiting concurrency to ensure no more than
     * `$concurrency` jobs ever run at once. It will return a promise which
     * resolves with the results of all jobs on success.
     *
     * ```php
     * $loop = React\EventLoop\Factory::create();
     * $browser = new Clue\React\Buzz\Browser($loop);
     *
     * $promise = Queue:all(3, $urls, function ($url) use ($browser) {
     *     return $browser->get($url);
     * });
     *
     * $promise->then(function (array $responses) {
     *     echo 'All ' . count($responses) . ' successful!' . PHP_EOL;
     * });
     * ```
     *
     * If either of the jobs fail, it will reject the resulting promise and will
     * try to cancel all outstanding jobs. Similarly, calling `cancel()` on the
     * resulting promise will try to cancel all outstanding jobs. See
     * [promises](#promises) and [cancellation](#cancellation) for details.
     *
     * The `$concurrency` parameter sets a new soft limit for the maximum number
     * of jobs to handle concurrently. Finding a good concurrency limit depends
     * on your particular use case. It's common to limit concurrency to a rather
     * small value, as doing more than a dozen of things at once may easily
     * overwhelm the receiving side. Using a `1` value will ensure that all jobs
     * are processed one after another, effectively creating a "waterfall" of
     * jobs. Using a value less than 1 will reject with an
     * `InvalidArgumentException` without processing any jobs.
     *
     * ```php
     * // handle up to 10 jobs concurrently
     * $promise = Queue:all(10, $jobs, $handler);
     * ```
     *
     * ```php
     * // handle each job after another without concurrency (waterfall)
     * $promise = Queue:all(1, $jobs, $handler);
     * ```
     *
     * The `$jobs` parameter must be an array with all jobs to process. Each
     * value in this array will be passed to the `$handler` to start one job.
     * The array keys will be preserved in the resulting array, while the array
     * values will be replaced with the job results as returned by the
     * `$handler`. If this array is empty, this method will resolve with an
     * empty array without processing any jobs.
     *
     * The `$handler` parameter must be a valid callable that accepts your job
     * parameters, invokes the appropriate operation and returns a Promise as a
     * placeholder for its future result. If the given argument is not a valid
     * callable, this method will reject with an `InvalidArgumentExceptionn`
     * without processing any jobs.
     *
     * ```php
     * // using a Closure as handler is usually recommended
     * $promise = Queue::all(10, $jobs, function ($url) use ($browser) {
     *     return $browser->get($url);
     * });
     * ```
     *
     * ```php
     * // accepts any callable, so PHP's array notation is also supported
     * $promise = Queue:all(10, $jobs, array($browser, 'get'));
     * ```
